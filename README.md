-->In this Java project, I utilized the Swing and AWT libraries to design and implement a graphical user interface that 
   closely resembles the Windows Notepad application. 

--> The application includes features such as a text editor, menu options, and basic file operations. 
    Through the use of Java's GUI components, I successfully recreated the familiar look and feel of Notepad, allowing users to open, edit, 
    and save text files.
